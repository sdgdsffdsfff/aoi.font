Fontelico
=========

This collection was started by [fontello project](http://fontello.com) to
collaborate different small sets, missed in other iconic fonts.
Also, it helps authors to share their works with community, as
font glyphs.

If you have not enougth icons, to create independent font, but still wish to
share - suggest your images here.


How to contribute
-----------------

1. Send your icons as SVG images. With your confirmation to distribute
   under [CC BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.
   - Height should be 1000px
   - Usually, image should be vertically centered, with 5% top and bottom
     margins. But it depends on content.
2. __Experimental.__ If you are not designer, but still wish to improve
   the world - we will create 1 icon for every 50$, donated by you to
   [fontello](http://fontello.com). That icon will be included here. Moreover,
   if you decide, that you are not satisfied, your money will be returned.

About attribution. Since Fontelico collaborates works from multiple authors,
we keep minimal attribution requirements, to be comfortable for users:

- You will be listed in contributors list, and any special details in font config file.
- When people uses Fontelico arts, mentioning of Fontelico in human readable
  form is considered enougth. Even if this is mentioned in HTML or CSS sources.
  We don't wish to force users giving links, tweets, buying coffee and so on.
